Most of Scotland moves to Level 2 on 17 May, except Glasgow City and Moray who remain at Level 3 due to high case numbers.    Travel around Scotland is permitted but you cannot enter somewhere with level three restrictions. In Glasgow City and Moray people should only travel in or out of the areas for permitted purposes. This means that the restrictions for C7 are now stricter than beforehand, despite increased freedoms in all Level 2 areas.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210521095026/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-57076243    https://web.archive.org/web/20210521100057/https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-protection-levels/pages/protection-level-2/",3.00,,,3.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,1.00,,0.00,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,4.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,1,,1,,35-39 yrs,16-19 yrs,2,0,0,2,5,,0,,4452756,154081,30.44,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,68.80,68.80,68.80,68.80,68.80,68.80,68.80,68.80,64.35,64.35,64.35,64.35,64.35,64.35,64.35,64.35,100.00,100.00

The step aligns France with the rest of the amber list now that the proportion of beta variant cases has fallen, where those who are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised and administered in the UK, US or Europe do not need to quarantine when arriving in England.    This move also simplifies the system to 3 categories, as well as the green watchlist to give travellers notice where green status is at risk.    arrivals from France will no longer need to quarantine if they are fully vaccinated  Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway to be added to the government’s green list for travel  India, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will also be moved from the red to the amber list  Georgia, Mexico, La Reunion and Mayotte added to the red list to safeguard domestic vaccine rollout    https://web.archive.org/web/20210806111415/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/international-travel-country-listings-update",2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,1.00,,0.00,,0.00,,3.00,0,,,,,3.00,0,,5.00,1,,2.00,0,,,,,2.00,0,,,,2,,3,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,5,,0,,5982581,157012,57.84,43.98,43.98,43.98,43.98,43.98,43.98,43.98,43.98,57.81,57.81,57.81,57.81,57.81,57.81,57.81,57.81,51.79,51.79,51.79,51.79,51.79,51.79,51.79,51.79,100.00,100.00

They will be allowed out for visits to gardens, parks and beaches from Tuesday without being forced to self-isolate upon their return.    The latest move to relax the restrictions on the estimated 420,000 people living in English care homes was announced as coronavirus rates continue to fall across the country. Almost 95 per cent of residents have received their first dose of the vaccine, while 71 per cent have been jabbed twice.    They remain forbidden for the moment to go out in groups or to meet more than one person at a time outdoors, although this restriction could be further loosened later this month.    Visits indoors, apart from to use toilet facilities, remain banned and people are urged to avoid taking public transport if possible.

The step aligns France with the rest of the amber list now that the proportion of beta variant cases has fallen, where those who are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised and administered in the UK, US or Europe do not need to quarantine when arriving in England.    This move also simplifies the system to 3 categories, as well as the green watchlist to give travellers notice where green status is at risk.    arrivals from France will no longer need to quarantine if they are fully vaccinated  Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway to be added to the government’s green list for travel  India, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will also be moved from the red to the amber list  Georgia, Mexico, La Reunion and Mayotte added to the red list to safeguard domestic vaccine rollout    https://web.archive.org/web/20210806111415/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/international-travel-country-listings-update",2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,3.00,,1.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,0,,,,,2.00,0,,5.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,2,,3,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,5,,0,,5403166,114278,57.63,23.15,23.15,23.15,23.15,23.15,23.15,23.15,23.15,43.49,43.49,43.49,43.49,43.49,43.49,43.49,43.49,35.42,35.42,35.42,35.42,35.42,35.42,35.42,35.42,100.00,100.00

Also, outlets that sell electrical goods; do key cutting; undertake shoe repairs, plus garden centres and plant nurseries can continue the collect service.    For qualifying businesses, staggered appointments will need to be offered to avoid any potential for queuing, and access inside premises for collection will not be permitted.    Analysis: Business clicks but doesn’t collect  2. Takeaway services  Customers in Scotland will no longer be allowed to go inside to collect takeaway food or coffee. Businesses will have to operate from a serving hatch or doorway.    The aim is to reduce the risk of customers coming into contact indoors with each other, or with staff.    3. Alcohol consumption  It will be against the law in all level four areas of Scotland to drink alcohol outdoors in public.

The essential visitor may visit the resident regularly indoors during a COVID-19 outbreak at the care home provided the resident or visitor do not themselves have COVID-19 (unless there are exceptional circumstances). This will ensure that people can continue to benefit from regular visits by a nominated essential visitor when wider restrictions on routine visits maybe in place.      To remove the limit of two indoor visitors at the same time per resident. This will now be subject to a risk assessment by the care home.  To remove the need for visitors to wear face coverings in outdoor areas of the care home.   To amend requirements on use of face coverings in indoor areas.

Today I can announce that passengers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day 8 test after arrival or, indeed, to self-isolate. They will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate proof of a negative COVID test taken 2 days before travel, and they must also take a post-arrival PCR test.  https://archive.vn/FNxIc",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,3.00,,2.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,2,,3,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,5,,1,,552741,6501,72.08,38.89,38.89,26.85,26.85,32.87,32.87,30.21,30.21,48.96,48.96,42.19,42.19,45.57,45.57,44.08,44.08,52.38,52.38,44.64,44.64,48.51,48.51,46.80,46.80,25.00,25.00
